# 4dle Website

This repository contains the source code for the 4dle website, a fun guessing game where you have to guess the name of a student in the class based on their characteristics. The website consists of multiple pages, each serving a specific purpose.

## Pages

### index.html

This is the home page of the 4dle website. It provides an introduction to the game and explains how it works. The page includes a header with a logo and navigation menu, a section with information about the game, and a footer with navigation links.

### about.html

The about page provides information about the creators of the website and their work. It includes details about the development process, the tools used, and the difficulties encountered. The page also concludes with a message from the creators. Like other pages, it has a header, a section with articles, and a footer with navigation links.

### us.html

The us page showcases the individuals behind the 4dle project. It includes articles introducing Maxime Guibert and Mathis Lair, providing information about them, their interests, and their roles in the development of the website. Clicking on the articles opens their respective LinkedIn profiles. The page also has a header, a section with articles, and a footer with navigation links.

### 4dle.html

The 4dle page is where the actual game is played. It includes a header, a form for making guesses, and a table for displaying the guesses made by the player. The page has a script file `script.js` for handling the game logic. It also includes a stylesheet `game.css` for styling the game interface.

### compatible.html

## Styling and Assets

The website uses cascading style sheets (CSS) to define the visual appearance and layout. The main stylesheet is `stylesheet.css`, which is linked to multiple pages. Additionally, each page may have its own specific stylesheet, such as `index.css` for the index page and `game.css` for the game page. The website also includes an image `4dle.png` used as the favicon.

## Usage

To use the website, simply open the desired page in a web browser. You can navigate between different pages using the links in the navigation menu located in the header or the footer. The game page (`4dle.html`) allows players to make guesses by entering characteristics of the student and see the results displayed in a table.

## Technologies Used

The website is built using HTML and CSS for the structure, layout, and styling. JavaScript is also utilized for the game functionality in the 4dle page. The development process likely involved a code editor such as Visual Studio Code.
